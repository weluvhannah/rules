----- [HOW OFFENSES WORK] -----
This post is dedicated to explaining how our rules operate. We believe it is imperative that rules are clear and not misunderstood, so we will always try our best to improve them and make them clear and easy to understand to ensure that your experience on the Network is enjoyable. In order to do so, we have created a system the applies an expiration between offenses. This page explains how it is managed and applied to the Network.

Offenses: This is defined as the number of times a rule has been violated within a set time period defined by the ladder expiration.

Ladder Expiration: The amount of days within which if a rule is violated again, the punishment applied will be of next offense. If the time between last punishment expired and next violation is more than this, then punishment will revert back to that of first offense.


[LIGHT OFFENSES (Applies to Light Rules Only):]

-> Light offenses tend to start with a warning, however they can skip the warning and lead to a 1 hour mute instead. They then progress  to a 1 day mute, 2 day mute, and so on. The ladder expiration is set at 7 days, meaning that once a mute expires, if the rule is broken again within 7 days, it will contribute to the offense ladder.

[MODERATE OFFENSES (Applies to Moderate Rules Only):]
 
-> Moderate offenses always begin with a 1 day mute and continue to go upwards in 2 day increments, meaning a 3 day mute is the second offense and the next offense is a 5 day mute. The ladder expiration is set at 14 days, meaning once the punishment expires, if the user breaks the same rule, it'll contribute to the offense ladder.

[SEVERE OFFENSES (Applies to Severe Rules Only):]

-> Severe offenses start off with a 7 day mute and continue to increase in increments of 7 days with each offense, meaning the second offense would warrant a 14 day mute. The ladder expiration is set at 31 days, meaning that if the rule is broken again within 31 days, it'll contribute to the offense ladder. This is to ensure that severe rules are more strict and violated less frequently, which will in turn make the community a safer environment.

[ALL OF THE RULES BELOW ARE CONSIDERED AS LIGHT RULES.]
[ALL OF THE RULES BELOW ARE CONSIDERED AS LIGHT RULES.]

[Spamming]
(Sending the same messages five times or more will get you punished for Spamming. Any attempt to bypass this rule will also get you punished for it, for example, waiting some seconds before sending the same message or sending a different message in between, either that being a dot or a whole sentence.)

[Chat Flood]
(Flooding the chat with messages, making it hard to read out what other players might be saying, or simply disrupting the chat is not allowed. It is not allowed to send 6/7 or more messages in a really short time span. This means that you cannot send short messages when in reality you could've said the same thing in one long message. We also consider Flood sending around 15+ random characters, such as "e3wwohohabfgDFG")

[Off-topic messages]
Sending messages to channels that are not made for it (example: having conversations in Selfie channels, looking for game duo in vent channel, etc.)

[Excessive Caps]
Sending a message / multiple messages with either: 3+ words or 15+ characters capitalized. Sending 3 messages with 1 capitalized word each also will count towards the rule and can get you punished; that means no splitting up and trying to bypass it. You might also be punished if you send a bit less than 15 characters in caps lock, depending on the context.

[General Rudeness / Swearing]
Being rude towards other players or members of the community. This also includes messages which do not include any certain swear words but are still rude towards players in general.

[Recruiting]
Asking people to contact you on another platform or through another means to advertise something to them in order to bypass the advertising rule is not allowed.

[Foreign Language]
You may not talk in public chat in another language other than in English. This rule includes to any message, even if it's only one word. There are however certain commonly known words, such as "Hola", "Bonjour", etc.

While we do not mean to discriminate or block certain languages from being used, we do need for the English language to be the only one used publicly, both for moderation purposes, as well as to give the chance for all the players to be able to understand what everyone else is saying.

Note: If you break any other more severe rule in another language, you will also be punished accordingly, such as swearing with a disability in another language.

[Arguing over punishments]
When complaining about a certain punishment that you have received, you may feel free to calmly and respectfully contact the staff member in question, asking them why you have been punished, etc. Doing so in a disrespectful and immature way, however, is forbidden. You will receive a verbal warning beforehand, though if you keep going, the punishments will follow the offense ladder. Regardless of how you handle this situation, if you feel that a staff member hasn't properly punished you, you may always feel free to report them in tickets, under "Staff Reports".
